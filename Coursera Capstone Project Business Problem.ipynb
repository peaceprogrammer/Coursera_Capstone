    "Hong Kong has emerged as one of the topmost alpha + world cities. Being emerged as one of the crucial center for economic activities, it has secured the seventh position among the largest trading centers of the world.

    "The purpose of this project is to locate some best spots for opening up a Vegetarian Restaurant in Hong Kong. The primary requirement is that the location should not be already busted with other restaurants. It must be noted that Hong Kong is already crowded with hundreds of restaurants which vary over sixty categories. Moreover, location should be near some scenic view point as well as farther from dense residential areas. The availability of nearby raw stuff (i.e. vegetables etc) market in a seafood preferred area would be another issue as well."
